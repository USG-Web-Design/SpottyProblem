				<h3 style="font-family: American Typewriter; font-size: 60; color: 0D496F"> Childhood </h3>
					<p style="; font-size: 30; color: 125F8F"> I was born in Amsterdam, the capital city of The Netherlands. I grew up there for the very early stages of my childhood. My family and I later moved down to the very South of The Netherlands to move away from the overwhelming and chaotic city and towards more of my family like my grandparents. We stayed there until my dad received a job offer which transported us from The Netherlands to the US. Now, we live in the beautiful state of Washington and go back to Holland every now and then to reunite with our family.</p>
