<br>
		<li> <u style="text-align: center;"> Underground Tour: </u> <!-- underlined since it's the name -->
			<br>
		Bill Speidel's Underground Tour is Seattle's most unusual attraction, a humorous stroll through intriguing subterranean storefronts and sidewalks entombed when the city rebuilt on top of itself after the Great Fire of 1889. </li> <!-- description-->
		<li> <u style="text-align: center;"> Pike Place Market: </u> <!-- underlined since it's the name -->

Pike Place, located at the waterfront in Seattle, has unique collection of shops, restaurants, and vendors featuring a wide range of fresh produce, seafood, cafés, and restaurants.

		<li> <u style="text-align: center;"> Leavenworth: </u> <!-- underlined since it's the name -->
			<br>
			Leavenworth is a beautiful Bavarian town that will give you a taste of Europe. Located in the mountains, this town is great to balance urban and outdoor activities. Leavenworth has snow tubing and downhill and cross country skiing as well as many museums. In the summer, Lake wanatchee is great for kayaking, swimming, camping, and any other water sport. There are also many trails with beautiful scenic views.
