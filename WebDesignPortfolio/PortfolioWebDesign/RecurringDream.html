			There I stood in -10 degree Celsius weather. Shivering with my tears crystallizing as they drip down my cheeks. My red dress contrasting against the pure snow and my silver slippers sparkling in cold dry air. Suddenly a woman approaches me in a motherly fashion. As the distance between us decreases, the sound of a violent caw by an aggresive bird marking its territory is heard. As I run towards the stranger in hope of warmth, I leap straight towards her big, fluffy, white marshmellow coat. Right as I am arms length away from comfort, her right leg swings towards me and into my stomach. The woman's bright red stilettos fling off her foot while I get kicked to the ground as I hold my stomach in agony. In fear of this woman I crawl backwards in an attempted escape but stumble while I try to get back on my feet. Whilst sobbing, I gain my balance and turn around to run away. But right before I am able to do any of this I smile to hide my emotions and my neck leaves my body as the vicious bird rips my body in half. My eyes match the snow and seconds later fill to match my color's dress. As my eyes shut, I feel my head being coddled against her great marshmellow coat.
