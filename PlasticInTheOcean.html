				<ul>
					<li> Plastic makes up 40% of the ocean's surface</li>
					<li> At current rates, plastic is expected to outweigh all the fish in the sea by 2050</li>
					<li> Thousands of seabirds and sea turtles, seals and other marine mammals are killed each year after ingesting plastic or getting entangled in it</li>
					<li> In the first decade of this century, we made more plastic than all the plastic in history up to the year 2000 </li>
					<li> Studies estimate there are now 15–51 trillion pieces of plastic in the world's oceans </li>
					<li> Not one square mile of surface ocean anywhere on earth is free of plastic pollution.  </li>
					<li> The fossil fuel industry plans to increase plastic production by 40 percent over the next decade </li>
					<li> Every bit of plastic ever made still exists  </li>

		<h1 class="Progression"> Progression of Plastic Pollution </h1>
				<ul>
					<li> <b> 1907: </b> first synthetic plastic. </li>
					<li> <b> 1930s: </b> Plastic production skyrocketted as more types of plastics were manufactured and a second industrial revolution occured. </li>
					<li> <b> WWII: </b> Plastics production again increased substantially as the demand grew for military equipment.  </li>
					<li> <b> WWII: </b> Even though much of the plastic did find its way to the ocean there was not much concern yet. </li>
					<li> <b>1946: </b> The movie <i> It's A Wonderful Life </i> emphasized the importance of plastic in our daily lives. </li>
					<li> <b>1989: </b> A study showed that 33/34 samples of ocean water had been contaminated with plastic and microplastics.</li>
					<li> <b> NOW: </b> A garbage truckload of plastic is being poured into the ocean every minute. </li>

			<img src="Solving-The-Mystery-of-Missing-Ocean-Plastic.png";>
			<p> This diagram shows the pathway from a river/shoreline to the stranded middle of the ocean. As it travels through river or disgarded at the shoreline, the plastic ends up where the waves crash. The plastic is taken and 43% sinks while the other 57% floats. 97% of the floating plastic is brought on shore while 3% stays afloat. The plastic on shore cycles through the waves and is eventually taken out to stay afloat (as part of the 3%). This 3% has a 1/3 chance of polluting offshore areas and a 2/3 chance of recirculating to eventually still pollute offshore areas. </p> </div>
